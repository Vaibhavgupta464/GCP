Use Python program, use Service Account “pubsubadmin”
Use topic1 and subscription sub2 created earlier
You can execute your Python program from Cloud Shell
Task:
Read messages from “topic1” using “sub2” subscription and write them into a file “msg_from_sub2.json”


--------------> Refer pubsub_part4.py

-------------------------------


What is the difference between “msg_from_sub1.json” ( created in part 2) and “msg_from_sub1.json” ? Why?

In msg_from_sub1.json we pull the message which was published by us manually through command line but 
In msg_from_sub2.json we pull the message which was published by us using python code.

msg_from_sub1.json does not have attributes in it. But msg_from_sub2.json has attributes as origin,username.
